ðŸ“± Flutter App Overview
This Flutter application was developed using Clean Architecture and the MVVM pattern. I utilized several useful packages to make the app efficient, clean, and maintainable.

ðŸ§  State Management
Used Riverpod, as it's one of the most modern and powerful state management solutions available. It provides flexibility, scalability, and simplicity â€” perfect for the app's structure.

I avoided using BLoC because the app is relatively small and doesn't require complex state management.

ðŸ“¦ Package Choices
Hive was chosen for local data storage due to its speed, ease of use, and familiarity.

persistent_bottom_nav_bar was used to create a smooth, animated bottom navigation bar quickly and effectively.

I avoided unnecessary packages like go_router since the app doesn't contain many screens, and basic navigation was sufficient.

ðŸ“¹ Demo
A complete walkthrough video is attached below, demonstrating the appâ€™s functionality and explaining how everything works.
